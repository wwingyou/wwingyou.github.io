Hello. Here, I write some serious blog post.

This is a `in-line code block`.

Below is long code block

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Blog!");
    }
}
```

This is a long line. this is an **emphasis**.

This is a *italic line*.

~~This is an breaktrought~~


How do I break multiple lines??? As you might can see, this is an great
oppertunity to do some long line of text to show my english skill. Well,
actually my English is BAD. I'm learning to write and speak English more
fluently, but it's pretty hard.
